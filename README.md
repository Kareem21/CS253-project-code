Imagine manipulation program that rotates,transforms and mirrors .alpha and .PGM images. Project was done for my CS253 (Software engineering in C++) class. The program reads in either .alpha or .PGM images and take CLI argument options like -r90 (rotate by 90% clockwise) 

Tasks included: Ability to rotate by factors
